# Intelligent-Recycling-Algorithm
The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that will recognize the different type of waste so it can be recycled correctly. In a first place, I will create a Neural Network that will categorize the different type of waste. Then, I will create an algorithm capable to detect an object from a camera.
